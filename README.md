- **Battle-tested**: 103 comprehensive test cases

## Installation

1. Copy `shlock` to your desired location:
```bash
cp shlock /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/shlock
```

2. Or use directly from the repository:
```bash
/ai/scripts/lib/shlock/shlock [OPTIONS] [LOCKNAME] -- COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

### Renaming the Script

You can rename the script to any name you prefer without affecting functionality. This is useful to avoid name conflicts with other programs:

```bash
# Rename to avoid conflicts
mv shlock sherlock
chmod +x sherlock

# Use with new name
sherlock backup -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
```

The script name is not referenced internally, so renaming has no effect on its operation.

### Requirements

- Bash 5.0 or later
- `flock` utility (usually from `util-linux` package)
- `/run/lock` directory (standard on most Linux distributions)

## Usage

```bash
shlock [OPTIONS] [LOCKNAME] -- COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

### Arguments

- **LOCKNAME**: Unique identifier for the lock (e.g., `backup`, `deployment`, `sync`)
  - **Optional**: If omitted, auto-generated from basename of COMMAND
  - Example: `shlock -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh` uses lockname "backup.sh"
- **COMMAND**: Command to execute while holding the lock
- **ARGS**: Optional arguments passed to COMMAND

**Important**: The `--` separator is required to separate options from the command.

## Options

| Option | Argument | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `--max-age` | HOURS | Maximum lock age before considered stale (default: 24) |
| `--wait` | - | Wait for lock to become available (blocking mode) |
| `--timeout` | SECONDS | Maximum time to wait for lock (requires `--wait`) |
| `-h, --help` | - | Display help message |
| `-V, --version` | - | Display version information |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Command executed successfully |
| 1 | Lock acquisition failed (held by another process or timeout) |
| 2 | Invalid arguments |
| 3 | Command failed |

## Examples

### Basic Usage (Non-blocking)

Fail immediately if lock is already held:

```bash
# Explicit lock name
shlock backup -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

# Auto-generated lock name (from command basename)
shlock -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

# Lock with arguments
shlock sync -- rsync -av /src /dest

# Lock with custom stale threshold
shlock --max-age 12 critical -- /path/to/critical.sh
```

### Blocking Mode (Wait Indefinitely)

Wait until the lock becomes available:

```bash
# Wait for deployment lock
shlock --wait deployment -- ./deploy.sh production

# Wait with custom stale threshold
shlock --max-age 6 --wait database-backup -- /usr/local/bin/db-backup.sh
```

### Timeout Mode

Wait up to a specified time:

```bash
# Wait up to 30 seconds
shlock --wait --timeout 30 sync -- rsync -av /src /dest

# Wait up to 5 minutes (300 seconds)
shlock --wait --timeout 300 report -- /usr/local/bin/generate-report.sh

# Critical task with short timeout
shlock --wait --timeout 10 healthcheck -- curl -f http://localhost/health
```

### Cron Job Usage

Prevent overlapping executions:

```bash
# In crontab with explicit lock name
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/shlock backup -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh 2>&1 | logger -t backup

# Using auto-generated lock name
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/shlock -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh 2>&1 | logger -t backup

# With timeout for long-running tasks
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/shlock --wait --timeout 3600 nightly-job -- /usr/local/bin/nightly.sh
```

### Systemd Service

```bash
# In your script or ExecStart
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/shlock --wait service-name -- /usr/local/bin/your-service
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure only one deployment runs at a time

if ! shlock --timeout 60 deploy-prod -- ./deploy.sh production; then
    echo "Deployment already in progress or timed out"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Error Handling

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if shlock database-maintenance -- /usr/local/bin/maintenance.sh; then
    echo "Maintenance completed successfully"
else
    exit_code=$?
    case $exit_code in
        1)
            echo "Lock is held by another process"
            ;;
        2)
            echo "Invalid arguments"
            ;;
        3)
            echo "Maintenance script failed"
            ;;
    esac
    exit $exit_code
fi
```

## How It Works

### Locking Mechanism

1. **LOCKNAME Resolution**: If LOCKNAME is omitted, derives it from the basename of COMMAND
2. **Lock File Creation**: Creates a lock file at `/run/lock/<LOCKNAME>.lock`
3. **Stale Lock Check**: If lock file exists, checks if it's older than `--max-age` hours
4. **Process Validation**: Verifies if the process that created the lock is still running
5. **Lock Acquisition**: Uses `flock(1)` for atomic, kernel-level locking
6. **PID Tracking**: Writes the script's PID to `/run/lock/<LOCKNAME>.pid`
7. **Command Execution**: Runs the specified command while holding the lock
8. **Cleanup**: Automatically removes PID file on exit; lock file persists for reuse

### File Locations

- **Lock files**: `/run/lock/<LOCKNAME>.lock`
- **PID files**: `/run/lock/<LOCKNAME>.pid`

Both are stored in `/run/lock` which is typically a tmpfs (RAM-based) filesystem that's cleared on reboot.

### Stale Lock Detection

A lock is considered stale when:
1. The lock file is older than `--max-age` hours (default: 24)
2. AND the process listed in the PID file is not running

If a lock is stale but the process is still running, the lock acquisition fails with a warning that the process has been running for an unusually long time.

### Waiting Modes

**Non-blocking (default)**:
- Attempts to acquire lock once
- Fails immediately if lock is held
- Best for: Cron jobs where you want to skip if already running

**Blocking (`--wait`)**:
- Waits indefinitely for lock to become available
- Acquires lock as soon as it's released
- Best for: Sequential tasks that must eventually run

**Timeout (`--wait --timeout SECONDS`)**:
- Waits up to specified seconds for lock
- Fails with exit code 1 if timeout expires
- Best for: Tasks with time constraints

## Use Cases

### 1. Prevent Overlapping Cron Jobs

```bash
# In crontab - runs every 5 minutes but skips if previous run is still active
*/5 * * * * shlock sync -- /usr/local/bin/sync-data.sh

# Or use auto-generated lock name
*/5 * * * * shlock -- /usr/local/bin/sync-data.sh
```

### 2. Serialize Database Operations

```bash
# Multiple scripts accessing the same database
shlock --wait database -- /usr/local/bin/db-operation-1.sh
shlock --wait database -- /usr/local/bin/db-operation-2.sh
```

### 3. Safe Deployment Pipeline

```bash
# Ensure only one deployment runs at a time
shlock --timeout 300 deployment -- ./deploy.sh "$ENVIRONMENT"
```

### 4. Resource-Intensive Tasks

```bash
# Prevent multiple instances of CPU/IO-heavy operations
shlock backup -- /usr/local/bin/full-backup.sh
shlock indexing -- /usr/local/bin/rebuild-search-index.sh
```

### 5. Graceful Service Restarts

```bash
# Prevent multiple restart attempts
shlock --wait --timeout 30 service-restart -- systemctl restart myservice
```

## Troubleshooting

### Lock Won't Release

**Symptom**: Lock appears held even though no process is running

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check for lock files
ls -la /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.*

# Check which process holds the lock
cat /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.pid
ps -p $(cat /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.pid)

# Force remove stale lock (use with caution)
rm -f /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.lock /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.pid
```

### Permission Denied

**Symptom**: Cannot create lock files

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check /run/lock permissions
ls -ld /run/lock

# Ensure your user can write to /run/lock
# Typically this requires being in the appropriate group or running as root
```

### Timeout Not Working

**Symptom**: `--timeout` flag not recognized or failing

**Check**:
1. Ensure you're using `--wait` with `--timeout`
2. Verify `flock` supports `-w` option: `flock --help | grep -e '-w'`
3. Update util-linux if needed: `apt-get update && apt-get install util-linux`

### Lock Always Considered Stale

**Symptom**: Lock is removed even when process is running

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify timestamp on lock file
stat /run/lock/YOUR_LOCKNAME.lock

# Check if system time is correct
date
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Meaningful Lock Names

```bash
# Good - explicit lock names
shlock database-backup -- ...
shlock customer-data-sync -- ...
shlock nightly-reports -- ...

# Also good - auto-generated from descriptive script names
shlock -- /usr/local/bin/database-backup.sh
shlock -- /usr/local/bin/customer-data-sync.sh

# Avoid
shlock lock1 -- ...
shlock temp -- ...
```

### 2. Set Appropriate max-age Values

```bash
# Short-running tasks (< 1 hour)
shlock --max-age 2 quick-sync -- ...

# Medium tasks (few hours)
shlock --max-age 12 backup -- ...

# Long-running tasks (overnight)
shlock --max-age 48 monthly-report -- ...
```

### 3. Use Timeout for Critical Paths

```bash
# Don't let deployments wait forever
shlock --wait --timeout 300 deployment -- ./deploy.sh

# Quick healthchecks should timeout fast
shlock --wait --timeout 5 healthcheck -- ./check-health.sh
```

### 4. Handle Exit Codes Properly

```bash
if ! shlock backup -- /usr/local/bin/backup.sh; then
    # Alert, log, or take corrective action
    echo "Backup failed or locked" | mail -s "Backup Alert" admin@example.com
fi
```

### 5. Log Lock Events

```bash
# In cron
* * * * * shlock task -- /path/to/script.sh 2>&1 | logger -t task-lock

# In scripts
shlock task -- /path/to/script.sh 2>&1 | tee -a /var/log/task.log
```

### 6. Combine with Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if lock is held too long

LOCK_FILE="/run/lock/backup.lock"
MAX_AGE_SECONDS=7200  # 2 hours

if [[ -f "$LOCK_FILE" ]]; then
    AGE=$(($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$LOCK_FILE")))
    if ((AGE > MAX_AGE_SECONDS)); then
        echo "Warning: backup lock held for ${AGE} seconds" | \
            mail -s "Lock Alert" admin@example.com
    fi
fi
```

### 7. Document Lock Dependencies

```bash
# README or comment in script
# This script uses locks:
# - "database-backup" - Exclusive access to database during backup
# - "file-sync" - Prevents concurrent rsync operations
#
# Dependencies:
# - database-backup must complete before file-sync can run
```

## Advanced Usage

### Nested Operations (Different Locks)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Outer operation
shlock operation-a -- bash -c '
    echo "Running operation A"

    # Inner operation with different lock
    shlock operation-b -- echo "Running operation B"
'
```

### Conditional Locking

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$FORCE" == "yes" ]]; then
    # Skip lock for forced execution
    /usr/local/bin/task.sh
else
    # Normal locked execution
    shlock task -- /usr/local/bin/task.sh
fi
```

### Integration with systemd

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Locked Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/shlock --wait my-service -- /usr/local/bin/my-service.sh
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lock file creation**: Negligible overhead (< 1ms)
- **Lock acquisition**: Atomic kernel operation (< 1ms)
- **Stale lock check**: Single file stat + process check (< 10ms)
- **Lock release**: Automatic on process exit

The utility adds minimal overhead to command execution, making it suitable for frequent operations and time-sensitive tasks.

## Security Considerations

1. **File Permissions**: Lock files inherit permissions from `/run/lock` (typically world-writable with sticky bit)
2. **PID Spoofing**: The utility validates process existence but doesn't verify process identity
3. **Race Conditions**: `flock` provides atomic locking, preventing race conditions
4. **Symlink Attacks**: Lock files are created with `>` redirection, following symlinks

For security-critical applications, consider:
- Running with appropriate user permissions
- Using dedicated lock directories with restricted permissions
- Implementing additional process validation

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if the system crashes while holding a lock?**
A: The lock file persists but becomes stale. On next acquisition attempt, it will be removed if older than `--max-age` and the PID is not running.

**Q: Can I use the same lock name from different scripts?**
A: Yes, that's the intended use. The same lock name ensures mutual exclusion across all scripts using it.

**Q: What if `/run/lock` doesn't exist?**
A: The script will fail. You can modify `LOCK_DIR` in the script to use an alternative directory like `/var/lock` or `/tmp/locks`.

**Q: Is it safe to use in containers?**
A: Yes, but note that locks are container-scoped. Different containers don't share locks unless they share the same `/run/lock` volume.

**Q: Can I use this with non-Bash scripts?**
A: Yes, you can lock any executable: `shlock task -- python3 script.py` or `shlock task -- /usr/bin/my-binary`

**Q: How many locks can I have?**
A: Practically unlimited. Each lock is just two small files in `/run/lock`.
